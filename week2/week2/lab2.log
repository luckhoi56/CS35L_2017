Lab 2 : Shell scripting

Part 1: 

Before I did anything else, I used locale to get data from the LC_*environment

locale Enter

All LC_* were in US.UTF-8  so I had to type:

export LC_ALL='C'

to make sure locale outputs the right things. I did locale command again, and now
the outout were all "C"

To sort the file in /usr/share/dict/words and copied it into my directory, I used:

sort /usr/share/dict/words > ~/CS35L/Lab02

To take a copy of the assign2.html, used the following command:

wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall17/cs35L/assign/assign2.html Enter

*Command:
tr -c 'A-Za-z' [\n*]' <assign2.html
Explain: The code says that to replace the complement in the range of A-Z and a-z with the new
line character. Basically any character not belongs to A-Z or a-z will be replaced with new line character

*Command:
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
Explain: This code is almost the same as the previous as the other one, but the extra s in -cs will make the 
file slightly different. For instance, if the file previously had multiples of new line character
because of the complement, now it only does new line one time, not repeating it.


*Command:
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort <assign2.html
Explain: This command is almost the same as previous one, but with sort command the 
output will be sorted lexicographically according to ASCII code ( due to C locale)

*Command:
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u <assign2.html
Explain: This command with -u will remove the duplicate, so we could not
see multiple new lines as the previous command

*Command:
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' <assign2.html | sort -u | comm - words 
Explain: This command after sorting the assign2, it will compare with the words file
. There were three columns. The first column responded to the unique non-duplicate words with new 
line character of assign2.html, the second column is the unique words of words file. The third 
column was the common characters of both file

*Command:
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'  <assign2.html | sort -u | comm -23 - words 
Explain: This command was almost the same as the previous command. The -23
means to suppress the column 2 and 3 of comm command, so we only care for the first
column now


Next I used wget http://mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdseng.htm Enter 
to get the copy of the web page
