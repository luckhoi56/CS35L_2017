Assignment 9: Change Management

I. Laboraroty: managing a backported change

1. get copy of the Diffutils from the main
website

$git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git

$cd diffutils

2. create log of changes
git log > git-log.txt

3. generate a list of tags


4. Find the commit,
generate a patch for that commit

Use vim to open the git-log.txt
and search for "maint: quote 'like this' 
or "like this", not `like this"
$vim git-log.txt
/maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this

$git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > quote-patch.txt

5.check out 3.0 version
I checkout into my own branch
$git checkout -b '2017_3.0' 'v3.0'

6. Apply patch
patch -p1 <quote-patch.txt

b. Problems:
Hunk #1 FAILED at 29.

1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file cfg.mk.rej
patching file doc/diagmeet.note
can't find file to patch at input line 222

Hunk #1 FAILED at 9.
Hunk #3 FAILED at 60.
2 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file README.rej

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

8. vc-revert:
revert the work file in the current VC
fileset to the last revision
diff mode :major mode used the output
(known as a patch)
vc-diff: compare the work
files in the current VC fileset with the version you 
started from (vc-diff)

9.For non .c extension file,
we only opened them using vc-diff (C-x v =) and 
then apply the vc-revert (C-x v u)
Enter yes
then C-x C-c to quit

-emacs NEWS 
-emacs README
-emacs TODO
emacs doc/diagmeet.note;
emacs ms/config.bat; 
emacs ms/config.site; 
emacs po/en.po;
emacs src/diff.h; 
emacs src/system.h; 
emacs tests/help-version

b. I then ran the following command to revert any changes
to comment hunks
emacs src/analyze.c
emacs src/cmp.c
emacs src/context.c
emacs src/diff.c   
emacs src/diff3.c
emacs src/dir.c
emacs src/ifdef.c
emacs src/io.c
emacs src/sdiff.c
emacs src/side.c
emacs src/util.c


Within each emacs, I used 
vc-diff (C-x v =) to get
the diff buffer, and then revert them
using C-u C-c C-a. I then exited
emacs with C-x C-c, yes, saved and quit



For all .c extension file, we
had to go through the
