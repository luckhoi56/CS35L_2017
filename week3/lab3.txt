Assignment 3: Modifying and rewriting software
Laboratory: Installing a small change to a big package

First I logged into the Seasnet Server
Then I downloadeded the assign3.html using:
1.wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall17/cs35L/assign/assign3.html
Get the copy of assign3

Next, I had to extract the url from the assign3.html,
which I used
2. vim assign3.html
Go into the html and extract the url
3. / Grab

Then I had to download the Coureutils 7.6,
which I used:
4. Copy the link then wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

Next I used tar -xvfz  coreutils-7.6.tar.gz to untar the 
tar file


5. Go into the directory of the file 
cd /u/ee/ugrad/khoil/CS35L/Lab03/coreutils-7.6

6. ./configure --prefix=$HOME/CS35L/Lab03/unfixed
7. make 
8. make install

#Reproduce the bug
9. cd $HOME/CS35L/Lab03/unfixed
10. cd bin
11. ./ls -l /bin/bash
Bug was found
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 942200 2017-02-15 04:37 /bin/bash



To fix the bug, I went back to the path ~/CS35L/Lab03/coreutils-7.6/src
To patch the file, I had to create a file, called patch using vim patch
and paste the portion of the patch into the file

diff --git a/src/ls.c b/src/ls.c

               }
           }
       /* Note we leave %5b etc. alone so user widths/flags are honored.  */


After that, I use 
12. patch ls.c <patch
To check if the was patched successfully, I had to re-compile the src
13. cd .. (note that I was in /u/ee/ugrad/khoil/CS35L/Lab03/coreutils-7.6)

14. ./configure --prefix=$HOME/CS35L/Lab03/fixed
15.make
16. make install

I cd back to the path $HOME/CS35L/Lab03/fixed/bin and typed ./ls -l /bin/bash

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 942200 Feb 15  2017 /bin/bash

The bug was fixed !
Went back to the src folder, I created two files, similarly 
in buggy ls and fixed ls. Here were the results:
18. touch -t 1504152240 oldDate( this meant 
created a file with time stamp 2015 April 15 at 22:40)
Here was the output in the fixed folder:
-rw-r--r-- 1 khoil eeugrad      0 Apr 15  2015 oldDate
-rw-r--r-- 1 khoil eeugrad      0 Oct 21 14:00 newDate

whereas, in buggy folder:
-rw-r--r-- 1 khoil eeugrad      0 2015-04-15 22:40 olDate
-rw-r--r-- 1 khoil eeugrad      0 2017-10-21 14:03 newDate
