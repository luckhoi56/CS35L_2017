Q1:
It is not necessaray to remove the line
"case_long_iso_time_style"
because in the patch the line
go to case_long_iso_time_style
has been deleted so case_long_iso_time_style
will never be reached again
Q2:
There are some countries in the world, such 
as China who prefers the other format. And 
by using the traditional format, only the 
English speaker can understand, thus causes
confusion

Q3: 
If we run ./randline.py /dev/null. The error would be
IndexError: list index out of range
It is because the exception only catches
numlines <0. randline.py assumes that 
the file has at something in it. Therefore,
when we will get index error when the file is empty

Q4:
alias python3=/usr/local/cs/bin/python3
python3 randline.py empty
I obtained the following error:
 except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
This is because Python3 no longer allow iteration
over exception tuple  (errno, strerror)
like Python2. To fix this, we can use

except IOError as err:
        errno, strerror = err.args
